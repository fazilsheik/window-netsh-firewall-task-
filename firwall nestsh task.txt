1. Open firewall configuration
Windows
GUI: Open netsh in windows 


Netsh (Admin Command Prompt):

cmd

netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on


netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all

3. Block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)


netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block Telnet Inbound" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=23

## 4. Test the rule

  telnet localhost 23
or on Windows:


Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 23

You should see the connection refused or timed out.

5. Add a rule to allow SSH (port 22) on Linux



## 6. Remove the test block rule (restore original state)

Netsh:

netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block Telnet Inbound"

8. How firewall filters traffic – Summary
Stateful inspection: Tracks connection states. Only initial handshake packets are checked; established connections follow internal “conntrack” rules 


.

Rule order & default behavior:

In Windows, default is to block unsolicited inbound and allow outbound.

In UFW, default is deny incoming, allow outgoing.

Evaluation process:

Incoming packet arrives.

Firewall checks if it’s part of an established connection.

If not, it matches rules by direction, port, protocol, IP.

Takes first matching rule’s action (allow/deny).

If none match, apply default policy.

Allows response packets if they match related sessions (stateful).
